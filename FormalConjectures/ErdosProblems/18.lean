/- ### Erdős's Conjectures -/

/--
**Conjecture 1.**
Are there infinitely many practical numbers $m$ such that $h(m) < (\log \log m)^{O(1)}$?

More precisely: does there exist a constant $C > 0$ such that for infinitely many
practical numbers $m$, we have $h(m) < (\log \log m)^C$?

theorem erdos_18a : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∃ᶠ m in atTop, Nat.IsPractical m ∧
      (practicalH m : ℝ) < (log (log m)) ^ C := by
  sorry

/--
**Conjecture 2.**
Is it true that $h(n!) < n^{o(1)}$? That is, for all $\varepsilon > 0$,
is $h(n!) < n^\varepsilon$ for sufficiently large $n$?
-/
@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem erdos_18b : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∀ᶠ n : ℕ in atTop, (practicalH n.factorial : ℝ) < (n : ℝ) ^ ε := by
  sorry

/--
**Conjecture 3.**
Or perhaps even $h(n!) < (\log n)^{O(1)}$?

Erdős offered \$250 for a proof or disproof.

@[category research open, AMS 11]
theorem erdos_18c : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∀ᶠ n : ℕ in atTop, (practicalH n.factorial : ℝ) < (log n) ^ C := by
  sorry

/--
**Erdős's Theorem.**
Erdős proved that $h(n!) < n$ for all $n \ge 1$.
-/
@[category research solved, AMS 11]
theorem erdos_18_upper_bound :
    ∀ᶠ n : ℕ in atTop, practicalH (Nat.factorial n) < n := by
  sorry

/--
**Vose's Theorem.**
Vose proved the existence of infinitely many practical numbers $m$ such that
$h(m) \ll (\log m)^{1/2}$. This gives a positive answer to a weaker form of Conjecture 1.
-/
@[category research solved, AMS 11]
theorem erdos_18_vose :
    ∃ C : ℝ, 0 < C ∧ ∃ᶠ m in atTop, Nat.IsPractical m ∧
      (practicalH m : ℝ) < C * (log m) ^ (1 / 2 : ℝ) := by
